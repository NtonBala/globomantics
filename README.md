# Globomantics

The project relates to [Building React Apps with TypeScript](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-apps-typescript-building/table-of-contents) Pluralsight course by [Mat Warger](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/mat-warger). It's based on Globomantics Conference website that allows to view information about the company and also view the set of speakers and sessions for an upcoming conference. The base app is written in React and JavaScript and the goal of the project is to update it to use TypeScript in order to leverage all the benefits of type safety during further development of new features and maintenance.

Original app was bootstrapped with [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) and then is updated incrementally to use TypeScript.

Original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/mwarger/globomantics-react-ts).
